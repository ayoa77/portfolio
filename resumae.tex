	{A multi-language, blog-style, business card application with search functionality for their product reviews and their self submitted articles/posts. I used our companies proprietary CMS that I built and extended on due to the use of indexing on the summernote based wysiwig descriptions. Instead of allowing summernote to add it\textquotesingle{}s extremely long Base64 string for the uploaded images, I interrupted this process uploaded the image to the server and then replaced the base64 string with the image url. This increased the write speed by 300\% on average, and the search speed by 250\% on average.}

Their customer\textquotesingle{}s could sign-up, commit to purchasing Jarvis. After purchasing the Jarvis, their account would be updated with the amount of Jarvis that they had purchased. I recommended and implemented an almost full user sign-up suite with an email-verification and a forgot-password flow. I also coded out a kyc - know your customer functionality, but was never deployed due to legality issues.}
